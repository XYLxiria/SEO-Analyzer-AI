# SEO-Analyzer-AI
This is application made to complete degree at Faculty Engineering - Wiralodra University. The exact name still on thought, and maybe on future this application still update (I'm still learn about updater)

The code is still in-line based, the developer is still new to python and github, please feel free if you want to request or improve as a contributor, any advice to do so.

This application uses several main libraries on python 3.12, such as:

1. nltk (punkt and stopwords)
2. spaCy (deleted on v2 alpha)
3. reportlab
4. pyQt5 as main GUI
5. matplotlib
6. skicit-learn

Please see changelog.txt in English or Indonesian, it may not be very complete because pulls are made simultaneously (developers only save and always debugging in local mode). Feel free to use because the code and release are based on MIT License..
